JCloudApp
=========

JCloudApp is inspired by [GloudApp](https://github.com/cmur2/gloudapp) and
provides similar feature set including taking screenshots and uploading files
to [CloudApp](http://getcloudapp.com/) via a status or tray icon. It runs on
all major platforms like Windows, Mac OS and Linux.
